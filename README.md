### Readme Requirements:


The header component adds a title to the page. The list component will take a list of items passed in as a property and create a div with all of the pokemon data (image, name, and number). Then, it renders this list of divs. My filter component takes in a list of items and filters them according to whichever option the user changes on the app. Each button triggers a state to change, therefore, updating the page. The states a user can change are the sort, generation, and type of pokemon. On page load, the pokemon are sorted in numerical order. The user can toggle between sorting alphabetically or numerically. A user can also choose if they see all generations of starter pokemon, or which specific generation of starter pokemon. Lastly, a user can choose to see all the types of starter pokemon, or which specifc type (fire, water, electric, or water). I applied visual and usability design principles from class. It is very clear which filters are applied when looking at the page. The buttons update to tell the user which selection they chose. Additionally, it is aesthetically clear that this is an app about starter pokemon, clearly labeling the pokemonâ€™s name and number. The overall goal of my app is to show and recategorize all types of starter pokemon for all the generations.
